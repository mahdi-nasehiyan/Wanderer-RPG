# Wanderer RPG
A university project implementing a simple RPG game called the 'Wanderer' using pure python and tkinter for the GUI. This repository is a fork of [this](https://github.com/kondfox/wanderer-python-start) repository which provides the image material for the GUI and some base initial code.
